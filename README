I have completed the pascal compiler to about 90%. I have TACs generated for all of the appendix A grammar, as well as multidimensional arrays and infinitely nested functions.
I have assembly code generating for everything but arrays and function calls. I have a good understanding how to go about doing it, but I have run out of time.
Unfortunately, I have projects for other classes as well as finals to study for. I feel if I had one more week, I could get this compiler to really shine.
I plan on working on it over the summer in my free time, to get arrays and functions working, as well as support for real values. I have spent so much time on it already,
it would kill me to let it sit unfinished. But here is what I have so far at least.

I learned a tremendous amount in this course. Not just about compilers, but also reaffirming my knowledge of computer architecture and assembly programming.
I'm sure this practice has done nothing but make foundation rock solid. I look forward to taking my final cs courses next year as a senior. I am ready.

I have included a file called FINALTEST.p to demonstrate what code I can generate thus far.

To run the compiler:     ./compiler FINALTEST.p > output.s             <-- need the redirection meta character, as the compiler just calls printf()
                         gcc output.s
                         ./a.out
