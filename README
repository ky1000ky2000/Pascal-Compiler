I have completed the pascal compiler assignment to about 90%. I have Three Address Codes generated for all of the assigned grammar, as well as multidimensional arrays and infinitely nested functions.
I have assembly code generating for everything but arrays and function calls. I have a good understanding how to go about doing it, but I have run out of time. 

I have included a file called TESTFILE.p to demonstrate what code I CAN generate thus far.

To build the compiler just run the make command.
To run the compiler:     ./compiler FINALTEST.p > output.s             <-- need the redirection meta character, as the compiler just calls printf()
                         gcc output.s
                         ./a.out
